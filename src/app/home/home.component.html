                Welcome to the mars getaway homepage! From here you can travel to the surface of mars following behind our marvelous rovers. 
                We have the Opportunity rover, Curiosity rover, and Spirit rover with many different cameras and angles to look through.
                One Sol represents one day on Mars, which is a little longer than one Earth Day. The Sol information you see in the information
                section is how many Sols have passed since that rover landed on Mars. Each rover has different cameras that you can choose to
                look through. Take a look around our travel page to find out more!
                After you are done exploring mars take some time to browse our shop and look at the space-themed merchandise.
